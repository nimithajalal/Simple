- ### Member authorization or `Authorization Code Flow (3-legged authorization)`: A LinkedIn member grants permissions to your application to access the memberâ€™s resources on LinkedIn. Your application has no access to these resources without member approval. Use this flow if you are requesting access to a member's account to use their data and make requests on their behalf. This is the most commonly used permission type across LinkedIn APIs. Open permissions available to all applications are of this type. These include`r_liteprofile`.
