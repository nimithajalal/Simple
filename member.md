- ### Member authorization or `Authorization Code Flow (3-legged authorization)`: A LinkedIn member grants permissions to your application to access the memberâ€™s resources on LinkedIn. Your application has no access to these resources without member approval. Use this flow if you are requesting access to a member's account to use their data and make requests on their behalf. This is the most commonly used permission type across LinkedIn APIs. Open permissions available to all applications are of this type. 
- ### Application Authorization or `Client Credential Flow (2-legged authorization)` : LinkedIn grants permissions to your application to access protected LinkedIn resources. If you are accessing APIs that are not member specific, use this flow. Not all APIs support Application Authorization. For example, Marketing APIs must use Member Authorization.
